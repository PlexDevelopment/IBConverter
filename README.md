# IBConverter
Convert TotalFreedomMod's indefinite bans to Plex's format

## Requirements
This project requires Python 3.7 or later. You will also need `pip` installed.
IBConverter will automatically install `pyyaml` for you.

## How to use
The script will ask you for the path to the TotalFreedomMod indefinitebans.yml file.
Once you enter it, the script will automatically convert every entry from TotalFreedom to Plex.
The Plex file will be saved as `indefbans.yml` in the directory you ran the script from.
Therefore, it is important you do not have the TotalFreedomMod file have the name `indefbans.yml` when running the script.
